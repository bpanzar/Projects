The data set published here includes 2,973,371 tweets from 2,848 Twitter handles.

### Data Cleaning

Keyword
searches also returned clutter from non-IRA affiliated accounts, most notably variations on IRA
handles; e.g. searches for the IRA handle @Brooooke returned tweets from @_Brooooke_, 
@__Brooooke__, @_Brooooke_X_ and seven other variations. We removed 17,980 tweets from
non-IRA handles.

We identified 24 handles with tweets not associated with IRA agenda building. Six handles
engaged in commercial activity (four marketed exercise and diet related activities, another
marketed payday loans, and a sixth marketed essay writing services). 18 accounts appeared to
engage in normal human behavior.1 We removed 154,832 tweets associated with these 24 handles.
828,219 tweets from 1,472 separate handles tweeted predominantly in a language other
than English. 

Finally, 1,034 handles on the list did not tweet during our sample period. 1,875,029 tweets
associated with 1,311 IRA handles remained for analysis. 

### Processing

- Unrestricted Open Coding -  examining, comparing, and conceptualizing the content. We considered
elements of tweets including the hashtags employed by a handle, cultural references within tweets,
as well as issues and candidates for which a handle advocated. 

-  We conducted axial coding to identify patterns and interpret emergent themes. 

- To verify the validity of results, near the end of axial coding, peer debriefing was conducted
(Creswell & Miller, 2000). This involved bringing in an external individual familiar with the
phenomenon to play devil’s advocate. 

------

- 178 handles with 10,838 total tweets could not be categorize due to insufficient activity. 

- The 1,133 remaining IRA-associated handles in our data were placed into one of five
categories. We each independently coded a sub-sample of 50 handles and found a Krippendorf’s
alpha reliability of .92 (note: error occurred only in accounts with extremely low tweet counts).


###  Ideas

- Categorize tweets by content
- Group tweets by twitter handle and then categorize by content
- Analyze how content of tweets changed over time for various categories

- Who had the most followers?

### Findings

'Unknown' and 'Commercial' seem really random

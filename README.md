# Projects
This repository contains my recent Data Science projects.  Currently the regression_movies project is the most polished.

- **classification_defaults**: A supervised classification project from the [Home Credit Default Risk](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk) Kaggle competition.

- **nlp_russian_tweets**: An NLP project using Russian Troll tweets released by 538.  Focuses on topic modeling using non-negative matrix factorization.

- **regression_inequality**: A supervised regression project attempting to predict levels of income inequality in over 50 different countries using data such as goervment tax and spending rates.  I build a Dash web app to explore the affect of policy changes on income inequality.

- **regression_movies**: A supervised regression project.  I scraped multiple websites to predict box office returns of a movie with a focus on movie content such as language, violence, and nudity.
